# stoNegaMe
## Project Overview
The goblinS have invented a game that, in their language, is impossible for us to pronounce,
but, in English, is called the stoNe gaMe. The two best gobliN players of all of the goblinS who
play the stoNe gaMe are unK and glooB. The game is played by setting up 3 piles of stones.
Each pile has 3 stones in it. On your turn, you can take 1 stone from any pile you like. If you
take the last stone from the last pile, you lose the game.
Display

### The list below includes the essential elements of the page.
* A fun display with some images of unK and glooB and maybe some stones.
* A display for each pile of stones, including the number of stones currently in the pile.
* A button for each pile that allows the user to take a stone from that pile.
* A display for unK and glooB’s comments about your gameplay.
* A reset button.
* A “How to Play” section.

## Functionality
unK and glooB will play as a team (it’s a 2-player game). glooB does all of the decision making,
but unK does all of the talking. The goblinS will go first.
On their turn, the goblinS will take 1 stone from the pile with the most stones in it. Even
though unK and glooB are the best among the goblinS they’re still not very good. After they
take their turn, unK will announce what they did and why it’s such a great move.
On the player’s turn, the player will click a button to indicate from which pile (s)he wants to
remove a stone. Don’t let the player take a stone from an empty pile. After the player takes
his or her turn, unK will announce why glooB thinks it was such a terrible move.
If either the player or the goblinS takes the last stone, the game will end. unK will make a
comment regardless of whether or not the goblinS won.
If the user should click the reset button at any time, all of the stone piles will reset to 3 stones
and the game will start over.
Note: This program is not linear and it cannot be treated as a simple click and respond. You
have to juggle the user’s turn (click and respond) with the computer’s turn (automatic) and
display the output as appropriate so that a person playing the game can follow the game.
